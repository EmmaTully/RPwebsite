Abstract:
We interpret gravity as the world's latency geometry and propose a falsifiable, global-only finite-refresh correction to the baryonic response in slow regimes. This work presents the conceptual foundations, information-theoretic motivation, and broader physical implications of the information-weight law
  w(r)=λ ξ n(r) (T_dyn/τ_*)^α ζ(r).
Quantitative validation on galaxy rotation curves is presented in the coordinated companion manuscript (Paper II). Series note: Paper I (this work) defines the fixed, global phenomenology and its scope; Paper II tests that w(r) on SPARC under identical masks/error model shared with all baselines. Both are co-submitted with shared artifacts and a single cover letter.
