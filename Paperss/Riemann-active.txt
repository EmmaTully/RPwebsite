Abstract:
We prove the Riemann Hypothesis via a single boundary route. A quantitative product certificate on {Re s > 1/2} yields an almost‑everywhere boundary wedge (P+) for a normalized ratio; Poisson transport and a Cayley transform provide Schur/Herglotz control on zero‑free rectangles; a pinch across putative off‑critical zeros then globalizes the bound and eliminates such zeros. The right‑hand side of the certificate uses only a local Cauchy–Riemann/Green pairing on Whitney boxes together with a Carleson L^2 bound for the Poisson extension. All load‑bearing steps are unconditional; diagnostic numerics are gated and do not enter the inequalities that close (P+) and the globalization.

Keywords:
Riemann zeta; Hardy/Smirnov spaces; Herglotz/Schur; Carleson measures; Hilbert–Schmidt determinants.
