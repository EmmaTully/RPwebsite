Abstract:
We present four theory results requiring no experimental input. (1) At a single universal anchor μ*, the mass display collapses to a closed form in the charge index Z and the golden ratio φ, f_i(μ*, m_i) = ln(1 + Z_i/φ)/ln φ, yielding equal‑Z degeneracy at the anchor and pure rung‑difference ratios φ^{Δr}. (2) A meta‑theorem: if the anchor is chosen by a standard stationarity principle and the fixed point depends smoothly and convexly on shared parameters, equal‑Z families respond coherently to any shared deformation at the anchor; per‑flavor tuning would necessarily break equal‑Z degeneracy and is therefore forbidden. (3) Discrete leptonic charge–parity from writhe parity of the neutral three‑cycle: trivial writhe enforces a Dirac branch with exactly vanishing 0νββ amplitude, while nontrivial writhe fixes a Majorana branch with maximal phase δ = ±π/2 and a narrow, computable band for m_{ββ}. (4) Under austere neutral locks (Dirac identity, zero neutral residue at the anchor, and neutral transport shared with charged sectors) the unique constructor triplet for neutrinos fails the oscillation‑ratio acceptance for both orderings, constituting a neutrino no‑go in the single‑anchor, no‑tuning framework and identifying minimal relaxation sites for any future closure.
